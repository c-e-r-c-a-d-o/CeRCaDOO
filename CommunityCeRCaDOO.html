<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p1> "Being alone, does not mean you are alone. "</p1>
<p2> "Some days are not worth repeating,
Some days are better left untold,
Some days might feel to heavy to share"</p2>
<p3> "Today I choose to be myself and no one else.
Today I choose to take care of me.
Today is the day that I finally learn how to love myself instead of punishing myself.
The day has come that I teach myself how to receive love instead of giving love and getting nothing back "</p3>

<h3> Inspiration </h3>
<p4> The most beautiful natural wonders that one has to familiarize himself/herself with, because they are absolutely wonderful, I am truly in awe of these pictures. I cannot wait to see them myself one day. Inspiration is something that knows many definitions, everyone looks differently at it. I however get inspired by so many different things, it is difficult to put into words what exactly inspires me and/or other people, therefore images, feelings, emotions and music speak louder than words. I can get truly inspired by looking at images or listening to some powerful music or touching poetry and stories.</p4>

<p6>I want to share a story with you, because you deserve to know the things that are not that easily shown. I have found myself in very dark places the last few years, I felt so sorry for myself, I played the victim in my own movie. I should have found ways to help myself, but every day got worse. At one point I didn't even move, I just layed in bed all day, doing absolutely nothing but feeling sorry for myself. If I looked back, there wasn't even a valid reason for behaving like that, I just felt miserable and by not letting anything in, I was shut off completley. I am so gratefull for my family and friends who literally dragged me out of it. Now that I look back I feel so powerful and strong, because I came back, I am back baby and I ams stronger than I ever was. I now treat hardships the same as opportunities, because this way I make rational, healthy choices. Looking at inspirational video's and motivational platforms also really helped me getting out of bed.</p6>

<br><p7>Going to a psychiatrist isn't something to be ashamed of. It took me many years to realize this. I finally dare to say "I am going to the psychiatre"as if it is the same as going to buy groceries. Think about your health and what works for you, it doesn't matter what other people think of you and there is no need to be ashamed. Everbody can choose to deal with their own private manners in their own way and I am happy that I finally realized that.</p7></br>
