<h3>Marketing Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li> I want to activate and motivate people who go through tough times. To remind people that 
obstacles can be meaningful important roadblocks to lead you to new insights and beautiful 
outcomes. </li>
<li>I want to inspire & create content that is not only inspirational and motivational but also 
lighthearted and funny. </li>
<li>I want to raise brand awareness throughout social media to encage more followers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Message & Context</h3>
<p1>Within my platforms I want to radiate inspiration and motivation. The importance of CERCADO is that it provides you to feel more inspired and motivated to bring back positivity into your life and to live your dreams. I share video's, positive affirmations to connect with my target audience. </p1>
<h4>Social Media Platforms </h4>
<p>I used two different platforms to engage with my target audience. I choose to work with both Instagram and Facebook. </p>
