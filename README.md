<h3> About Cercado</h3>
<p1>Cercado consists of two words: Cerca and Cercado. Cerca means being close to
something while Cercado is the spanish word for closed. The combination of these
two words is precisly what I want to display. You have got to work hard to turn
obstacles into possibilites, but one thing is for sure. You will shine brighter.
Come and have a look on the brighter side! </p1>
